# Franklin's 13 Virtues

On occasion, I tend to re-read books that have helped me through the years. For example, I regularly re-read [Dale Carnegie's books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439167346/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=stubai-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1439167346), [David Allen's "Getting Things Done"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=stubai-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0142000280), and others. Right now, I'm re-reading [Benjamin Franklin's autobiography](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936594374/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=stubai-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1936594374). Although I don't think he ever got around to publishing his "Art of Virtue" book, I do like reading how he applied his 13 virtues to his life. Here they are:

1. **Temperance**: Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.
2. **Order**: Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.
3. **Resolution**: Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.
4. **Frugality**: Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.
5. **Moderation**: Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.
6. **Industry**: Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.
7. **Cleanliness**: Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.
8. **Tranquility**: Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.
9. **Silence**: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.
10. **Sincerity**: Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
11. **Justice**: Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.
12. **Chastity**: Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.
13. **Humility**: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.
