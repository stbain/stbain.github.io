A friend of mine is finishing up a BSCS and looking to get into the tech industry. Ready to code? Here's the list I sent him...

## Foundation

* Pick a Linux distro ([Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) or [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)). I would recommend Fedora if this is your first encounter with Linux.
* Read [_How to Become a Hacker_](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)
* Read [_The Art of Unix Programming_](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/)

## Tools and Environment

* Master Vim ([http://www.vim.org/](http://www.vim.org/))
  * This is kind of a personal preference, as are all editors.
  * I recommend mastering vim because it is ubiquitous. You can run it on all of your workstations (Linux / Win) **and** you can usually depend on it being installed on just about every Linux server you SSH to.
  * Being able to use the same editor everywhere has its advantages.

## Programming Languages

* Read [_Learn Python the Hard Way_](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
* Read [_Pro Git_](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## Web Development

* [Install Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/), then run through [the tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/)
* Read [_Test Driven Development with Python_](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc)

## JavaScript Ecosystem

* Learn JavaScript (fundamental language skills)
* Learn modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, or Angular)
* Learn NodeJS for backend development
* Explore full-stack frameworks

## Additional Skills to Pick Up

* **Cryptography** - Understanding security fundamentals
* **Web services and REST APIs** - Modern application architecture
* **Security** - Essential for any developer
* **Networking** - Understanding how systems communicate

## Database Technologies

### Start with:
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL  
* MongoDB

### Move up to:
* DynamoDB (Amazon's AWS)
* Modern NoSQL databases
* Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server if you have to

## 2024 Update Notes

Since writing this in 2016, the landscape has evolved significantly. Consider these modern additions:

* **Cloud platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP fundamentals
* **Containerization**: Docker and Kubernetes
* **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+, TypeScript
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, AWS CDK

The fundamentals remain solid, but the tooling has advanced considerably. The core principle still applies: master the fundamentals, then build on them with modern tools and practices.
