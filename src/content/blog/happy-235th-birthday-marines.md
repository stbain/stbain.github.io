Today marks the 235th birthday of the [United States Marine Corps](http://www.marines.com). What many people don't know is that the Marine Corps was "born in a bar." The USMC Heritage page tells the story best:

> **"On November 10, 1775, the Continental Congress commissioned Samuel Nicholas to raise two Battalions of Marines. That very day, Nicholas _set up shop_ in Tun Tavern. He appointed Robert Mullan, then the proprietor of the tavern, to the job of chief Marine Recruiter — serving, of course, from his place of business at Tun Tavern. Prospective recruits flocked to the tavern, lured by (1) cold beer and (2) the opportunity to serve in the new Corps of Marines. So, yes, the U.S. Marine Corps was indeed _born_ in Tun Tavern. Needless to say, both the Marine Corps and the tavern thrived during this new relationship."**

Semper Fi, Marines. God bless each and every one of you, but there is one in particular I would like to thank for his service today: Major Nigel Fischer. Nigel and I served at Marine Corps Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 369 in Camp Pendleton back in the mid-1990's. Semper Fi, brother and God bless you and yours.
