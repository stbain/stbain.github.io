One question I am often asked is, "Where do you work?"

**Short Answer:** Lots of places. I tend to stay busy.

**Long Answer:**
 
- I spend my “day job” hours (and plenty of night and weekend hours) as a Solutions Architect for [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- I do some side work and provide services through PacketVision LLC for friends and family.
- I am a TV co-host, “The Geek” on the television show "Deet and The Geek". The TV show has not produced any new episodes in a while as the cast and crew are busy with a lot of other stuff; however, you can still view the old episodes (as well as plenty of outtakes and other content) on our [YouTube channel (click here)](https://youtube.com/DeetAndTheGeek).

Aside from the work listed above…

- I am an active member of my church, First Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Roanoke, VA.
- I am a Freemason. I am a member and Past Master of Pleasants Masonic Lodge #63 AF&AM, Roanoke, VA.
- I am active in other organizations such as local political groups. I served as the Chair of the Salem Republican Committee. In the past, I served as an officer in the Roanoke Valley RLC and as Parliamentarian for the Roanoke City and Bedford County Republican Committees. I often volunteer to serve as Parliamentarian for political units for meetings, conventions, and other events as needed. In the past, I ran for political office. Although the website for my campaign no longer exists, the [Facebook Page (click here)](https://facebook.com/stuart.bain.official) does, and I still use it to discuss politics on occasion with friends and former campaign followers. Feel free to like the page if you want to talk politics. I try to refrain from discussing politics on my personal Facebook page as it is reserved for family and friends.
