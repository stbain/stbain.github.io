This was in ye olde email inbox this morning.

Two patients limp into two different medical clinics with the same  
complaint. Both have trouble walking and appear to require hip surgery.

The FIRST patient is examined within the hour, is x-rayed the same day and  
has a time booked for surgery the following week.

The SECOND sees his family doctor after waiting 3 weeks for an  
appointment, then waits 8 weeks to see a specialist, then gets an x-ray,  
which isn&#8217;t reviewed for another week and finally has his surgery  
scheduled for 6 months from then pending the review boards decision on his  
age and remaining value to society.

Why the different treatment for the two patients?

The FIRST is a Golden Retriever taken to a vet.  
The SECOND is a Senior Citizen on Obamacare.

In November if Barack Obama and his Czars get another term we&#8217;ll all have to find a  
good vet.
