A husband and wife were traveling the country, celebrating their golden years together. They went to breakfast at a restaurant where the &#8216;senior special&#8217; was two eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast for $2.99.

&#8216;Sounds good,&#8217; the wife said.  &#8216;But I don&#8217;t want the eggs..&#8217;

&#8216;Then, I&#8217;ll have to charge you $3.49  because you&#8217;re ordering a la carte,&#8217;  the waitress warned her.

&#8216;You mean I&#8217;d have to pay for  not taking the eggs?&#8217;  the wife asked incredulously.

&#8216;YES!&#8217; stated the waitress..

&#8216;I&#8217;ll take the special then,&#8217; the wife said..

&#8216;How do you want your eggs?&#8217;  the waitress asked.

&#8216;Raw and in the shell,&#8217; the wife replied.  She took the two eggs home  and baked a cake.

Moral of the story:

DON&#8217;T MESS WITH SENIORS!!!  
They&#8217;ve been around the block more than once!
