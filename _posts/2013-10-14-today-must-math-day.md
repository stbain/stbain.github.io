Today I ran across two separate math articles from two different sources.

The first was a video from a segment on the [Dave Ramsey show](http://www.daveramsey.com/). He talks about Obamacare and how you are not exempt from math regardless of whether you are a Republican or a Democrat. He also mentions the effects of being forced to purchase insurance. Have a look:**

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">The second was an article brought to my attention by a friend:</span>

# [The modern-day &#8216;slave class&#8217; is anyone who cannot do math&#8230; and that&#8217;s about 95% of the population (click here)](http://www.naturalnews.com/040027_financial_slavery_money_investments.html#)

Overall, it is a good read. I do not agree 100% with everything the article has to say. For example, I understand that it is a wise decision to transfer risk by purchasing certain types of insurance (such as term life insurance and homeowner&#8217;s insurance). The article does bring up the control factor of taxation and the national debt. That, I can certainly appreciate.

There was a slight bit of overlap between the two, but they underlying premise is more or less the same:

## **<span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>You are not excused from math!</em></span>**

It does not matter what you believe or don&#8217;t believe either side of politics.

  * Do not fall victim to any of the &#8220;loudest voice in the room&#8221; arguments on either side of the political spectrum
  * Do not buy into the euphemisms designed to cover up the theft imposed on you by the government
  * Do not be fooled by the trickery used to mask the true nature of our country&#8217;s dire financial situation
