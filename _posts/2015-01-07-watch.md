This was seen on Facebook, but I&#8217;ll count it as a mailbag post.

A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and on being told that there was a fortune in horse-racing, decided to purchase one and enter it in the races. However at the local auction, the going price for a horse was so high that he ended up buying a donkey instead.

<div>
  He figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races. To his surprise, the donkey came in third! The next day the local paper<span class="text_exposed_show"> carried this headline:</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> <b>PREACHER’S ASS SHOWS</b></span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won. The paper read:</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> <b>PREACHER’S ASS OUT IN FRONT</b></span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> The bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race. The paper headline read:</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> <b>BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER’S ASS</b></span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> This was too much for the bishop, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the donkey. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent. The paper headline the next day read:</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> <b>NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN</b></span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> The bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for ten dollars. The next day the paper read:</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> <b>NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.00</b></span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> This was too much for the bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back the donkey and lead it to the plains where it could run wild. The next day, the headlines read:</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> <b>NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE</b></span>
</div>

<div>
  <span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> The bishop was buried the next day.</span>
