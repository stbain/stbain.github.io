For my personal website and pet project web hosting needs, I have a [GoDaddy](http://x.co/KruL) account that I pay for. Here recently, the account was moved to new [GoDaddy](http://x.co/KruL) servers complete with SSH capability! The move wasn&#8217;t completely without problems. I had to manually update the DSN connection string for some of the databases my sites use (including this one) to get them backup and running. Regardless, I must say I&#8217;m somewhat impressed. I logged in via SSH to look around and was able to use Linux shell commands and vi to take care of some minor edits without problems. For a Linux person like me, this sort of ability is a HUGE timesaver. I am VERY happy with [GoDaddy](http://x.co/KruL) putting these sorts of abilities out there for people like me. If you&#8217;re looking for some [cheap hosting for your personal or pet project website(s), click here](http://x.co/KruL). However, for businesses looking for [secure, 100% uptime hosting, Blue Ridge Digital](http://blueridgedigital.com/) is the way to go.
