Even though I do not own a standalone [Amazon Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HFS6Z0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=stubai-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B004HFS6Z0) device, I am Kindle user. I use the Kindle application on my smartphone to read books. I considered buying a Kindle, but have not done so yet. I would love to have one, but don&#8217;t have the cash to justify reading the books on another device instead of my phone when reading them on my phone works just fine.

Amazon recently introduced [a new version of the 3rd generation Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HFS6Z0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=stubai-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B004HFS6Z0). It is nearly identical to the Wifi-only version but shows advertisements when the device is &#8220;off&#8221; and on the home screen when browsing books and whatnot. For this, you get $25 off the price of $139. This leaves you at $114 for a device with ads vs. $139 for a device without ads. Not worth the $25 right now if you ask me; HOWEVER, I think over time we will see the price come down even further. If it is a viable advertising platform, I think Amazon will get to a &#8220;sell the razor cheap but mark up the razor blades&#8221; style of thinking. I can see a future where Amazon Kindles are more in the $20-50 range if you agree to advertising and perhaps carry a subscription of some sort (perhaps two or more paid magazine or newspaper subscriptions) on it. This model seems to work for the mobile phone industry. My [$700 Android phone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KZP4BQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=stubai-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B004KZP4BQ) only cost me $99 as a result. I bet it will also work for Amazon once they work out the particulars.
