How would you have responded to this email I received? Comment and I will compile the list and send it back to them.

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>Hello,</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>I hope this email finds you well. I am ###### ####### and I am with the Virginia Department of Business. I am contacting you in response to some comments you left when responding to our recent survey.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>You comment said that you have too many comments and suggestions to list. Here at the Virginia DBA we would like to hear them. The Commonwealth is looking everywhere we can for ideas that will help get people back to work. The one thing that I ask is that when you send us your ideas make sure to select &#8220;reply all&#8221; to this email so that it will also go to our Director of Business Information Services, ##### #######. Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.</em>
