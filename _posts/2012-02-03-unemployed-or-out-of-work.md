This was in my email inbox this morning.

**Why donâ€™t we hear about this on the news???**

Abbot and Costello

COSTELLO: I want to talk about the unemployment rate in America.  
ABBOTT: Good subject. Terrible times. It&#8217;s about 9%.

COSTELLO: That many people are out of work?  
ABBOTT: No, that&#8217;s 16%.

COSTELLO: You just said 9%.  
ABBOTT: 9% unemployed.

COSTELLO: Right: 9% out of work.  
ABBOTT: No, that&#8217;s 16%.

COSTELLO: Okay, so it&#8217;s 16% unemployed.  
ABBOTT: No, that&#8217;s 9%.

COSTELLO: WAIT A MINUTE. Is it 9% or 16%?  
ABBOTT: 9% are unemployed. 16% are out of work.

COSTELLO: If you&#8217;re out of work you&#8217;re unemployed.  
ABBOTT: No, you can&#8217;t count the &#8220;Out of Work&#8221; as the unemployed. You have to look for work to be unemployed.

COSTELLO: But &#8230; They&#8217;re out of work!  
ABBOTT: No, you miss my point.

COSTELLO: What point?  
ABBOTT: Someone who doesn&#8217;t look for work can&#8217;t be counted with those who look for work. It wouldn&#8217;t be fair.

COSTELLO: To whom?  
ABBOTT: The unemployed.

COSTELLO: But they&#8217;re ALL out of work.  
ABBOTT: No, the unemployed are actively looking for work&#8230; Those who are out of work stopped looking. They gave up. If you give up, you&#8217;re no longer in the ranks of the unemployed.

COSTELLO: So if you&#8217;re off the unemployment roles, that would count as less unemployment?  
ABBOTT: Unemployment would go down. Absolutely!

COSTELLO: The unemployment goes down just because you don&#8217;t look for work?  
ABBOTT: Absolutely it goes down. That&#8217;s how you get to 9%. Otherwise it would be 16%. You don&#8217;t want to read about 16% unemployment do ya?

COSTELLO: That would be frightening.  
ABBOTT: Absolutely.

COSTELLO: Wait, I got a question for you. That means there are two ways to bring down the unemployment number?  
ABBOTT: Two ways is correct.

COSTELLO: Unemployment can go down if someone gets a job?  
ABBOTT: Correct.

COSTELLO: And unemployment can also go down if you stop looking for a job?  
ABBOTT: Bingo.

COSTELLO: So there are two ways to bring unemployment down, and the easier of the two is to just stop looking for work.  
ABBOTT: Now you&#8217;re thinking like an economist.

COSTELLO: I don&#8217;t even know what the hell I just said!

And now you know why Pres Obama&#8217;s unemployment figures are improving.
