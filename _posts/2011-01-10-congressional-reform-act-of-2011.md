The mailbag hits just keep on coming. During my run for U.S. House, I received this one (or variations of it) multiple times. Usually at least once a day. It was sent again today via Carolyn B. Have an opinion on it? Leave a comment below!

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>The 26th amendment (granting the right to vote for 18 year-olds) took only 3 months & 8 days to be ratified! Why? Simple! The people demanded it. That was in 1971&#8230;before computers, before e-mail, before cell phones, etc.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>Of the 27 amendments to the Constitution, seven (7) took 1 year or less to become the law of the land&#8230;all because of public pressure.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>I&#8217;m asking each addressee to forward this email to a minimum of twenty people on their address list; in turn ask each of those to do likewise.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>In three days, most people in The United States of America will have the message. This is one idea that really should be passed around.</em>

</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>1. Term Limits.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  <em>12 years only, one of the possible options below..</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  <em>A. Two Six-year Senate terms</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  <em>B. Six Two-year House terms</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  <em>C. One Six-year Senate term and three Two-Year House terms</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>2. No Tenure / No Pension.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  <em>A Congressman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they are out of office.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>3. Congress (past, present & future) participates in Social Security.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  <em>All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>4. Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, just as all Americans do.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>5. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>6. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>7. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>8. All contracts with past and present Congressmen are void effective 1/1/11.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  <em>The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen. Congressmen made all these contracts for themselves.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">
  <em><br /> </em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>Serving in Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term(s), then go home and back to work.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>If each person contacts a minimum of twenty people then it will only take three days for most people (in the U.S. ) to receive the message. Maybe it is time.</em>
</p>

  <em>THIS IS HOW YOU FIX CONGRESS!!!!! If you agree with the above, pass it on. If not, just delete</em>
