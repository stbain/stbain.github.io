Today marks the 225th anniversary of the 1787 Continental Congress signing the United States Constitution in Philadelphia.

_&#8220;The two enemies of the people are criminals and government, so let us tie the second down with the chains of the Constitution so the second will not become the legalized version of the first.&#8221;_ &#8212; Thomas Jefferson

Now we just need to elect a slate of legislators and a President who intend to uphold their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
