Today&#8217;s Mailbag found a joke from Paul B. I had received this one a time or two before. Worthy of a laugh.

* * *

_One day a florist went to a barber for a haircut. After the cut, he asked about his bill, and the barber replied, &#8216;I cannot accept money from you, I&#8217;m doing community service this week.&#8217; The florist was pleased and left the shop. When the barber went to open his shop the next morning, there was a &#8216;thank you&#8217; card and a dozen roses waiting for him at his door. Later, a cop comes in for a haircut, and when he tries to pay his bill, the barber again replied, &#8216;I cannot accept money from you , I&#8217;m doing community service this week.&#8217;  The cop was happy and left the shop. The next morning when the barber went to open up, there was a &#8216;thank you&#8217; card and a dozen donuts waiting for him at his door. Then a Congressman came in for a haircut, and when he went to pay his bill, the barber again replied, &#8216;I can not accept money from you. I&#8217;m doing community service this week.&#8217; The Congressman was very happy and left the shop. The next morning, when the barber went to open up, there were a dozen Congressmen lined up waiting for a free haircut._

_And that, my friends, illustrates the fundamental difference between the citizens of our country and the politicians who run it._
