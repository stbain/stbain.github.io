Funny mailbag joke I just couldn&#8217;t pass up sharing:

<address style="padding-left: 30px">
  I don&#8217;t know WHY I didn&#8217;t figure this out sooner!!!!! It&#8217;s the shampoo I use in the shower! When I wash my hair, the shampoo runs down my whole body, and (duh!)  printed very clearly on the shampoo label is this warning,</p> 
  
  <p>
    &#8220;FOR EXTRA VOLUME AND BODY.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No WONDER I have been gaining weight!!!  Well! I have gotten rid of that shampoo and I am going to start using Dawn dish soap instead. Its label reads, &#8220;DISSOLVES FAT THAT IS OTHERWISE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE.&#8221; Problem solved!

If only it were that easy.
