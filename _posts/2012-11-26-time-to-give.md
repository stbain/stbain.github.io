As you know, I believe private charity is superior to government programs. To that end, I ask all of you to dig in deep this year and help. We have a friend in need. My good friend Darryl Buchannon was instrumental during my 2010 campaign, but he has recently fallen on hard times. He wants to give his family a great holiday season this year. Every bit counts!
