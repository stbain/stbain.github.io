Another joke from the mailbag. Enjoy:

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  A few minutes before the church services started, the congregation was sitting in their pews and talking.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  Suddenly, Satan appeared on the altar of the church.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  Everyone started screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from evil incarnate.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  Soon the church was empty except for one elderly cowboy who sat calmly in his pew without moving, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God&#8217;s ultimate enemy was in his presence.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  So Satan walked up to the man and said, &#8216;Do you know who I am?&#8217;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  The old cowboy replied, &#8216;Yep, sure do.&#8217;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you afraid of me?&#8217; Satan asked.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  &#8216;Nope, sure ain&#8217;t.&#8217; said the cowboy.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  &#8216;Don&#8217;t you realize I can kill you with one word?&#8217; asked Satan.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  &#8216;Don&#8217;t doubt it for a minute,&#8217; returned the old man, in an even tone.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  &#8216;Did you know that I can cause you profound, horrifying AGONY for all eternity?&#8217; persisted Satan.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  &#8216;Yep,&#8217; was the calm reply.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  &#8216;And you are still not afraid of me?&#8217; asked Satan.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  &#8216;Nope,&#8217; said the old cowboy.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  More than a little perturbed, Satan asked, &#8216;Why aren&#8217;t you afraid of me?&#8217;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  The old cowboy calmly replied,
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  &#8216;Been married to your sister for 48 years. &#8216;
