One thing I learned over the years is that if a work is created by the government, it is in the public domain. This means if a book is written, a work of art painted, or even a photograph snapped by the government, it belongs to everyone and they can use it to their liking with or without the creator&#8217;s permission. This includes use for profitable and commercial purposes. Today I learned that there is more than meets the eye. Enter [the Bayh Dole Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh%E2%80%93Dole_Act).

I noticed [on the White House website](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/03/29/americas-next-top-energy-innovator) that the government was somehow charging for use of patents created through government funding. Since I thought the government&#8217;s work was all public domain, this confused me a little. I decided to ask someone in the know. I found a ranking U.S. Department of Energy official&#8217;s email address and asked her. Her response was:

> &#8220;Lab IP is owned by Lab M&O contractor, unless they pass on it back to ther federal govt.  
> See Bayh Dole&#8221;

After reading [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh%E2%80%93Dole_Act) in detail, I thanked her for the information and went on about my day. Then it hit me&#8230; what if, for example, I funded billions of dollars of research and came up with a widget and patented it. Then the government decided to fund research for a similar widget and let the researcher keep the patent? My widgets would, understandably, be ridiculously overpriced to absorb the R&D costs whereas my competition could charge a percentage and still make huge profits. Something just isn&#8217;t right about that. How do we fix it? I can certainly think of a few ideas. Perhaps it is time for some grant funding reform.
