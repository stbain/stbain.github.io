As some of you know, my studies were a blend of business, computer science, marketing, and economics. I am one of those rare cases where what I did my degree work in actually applies to my career from day to day. Most of my daily work is working with Auctioneers who want to market themselves and/or their auctions. With the rise of social media in recent years, it has been somewhat of a struggle to get them acclimated to the new marketing opportunities presented by social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter. Struggle? Not <a title="RMEB" href="http://www.facebook.com/coloradoauctioneer" target="_blank">this guy</a>! Look carefully at this screenshot from his company&#8217;s fan page:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-150" title="What is this?" src="http://mc.packetvision.net/stuartbain/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2011/02/whitley.png" alt="Looks like a stick!?" width="520" height="384" srcset="https://stuartbain.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2011/02/whitley.png 520w, https://stuartbain.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2011/02/whitley-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 85vw, 520px" />](http://mc.packetvision.net/stuartbain/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2011/02/whitley.png)So let&#8217;s analyze this for just a minute.

  1. It has a call to action, the **challenge** (&#8220;What is this?&#8221;)
  2. You have to be a fan to see the full size image and win the prize (&#8220;Building the tribe&#8221;)
  3. The person who wins gets&#8230;. a **BRANDED** hat to wear and advertise RMEB (&#8220;Branding 101&#8221;)

Well done, Mr. Whitley. Interaction via Facebook at its finest. Everyone should do two things:

First: <a title="RMEB" href="http://www.facebook.com/coloradoauctioneer" target="_blank">Click here and &#8220;Like&#8221; Mr. Whitley&#8217;s company fan page</a>.

Second: <a title="Rasmus Auctioneers" href="http://www.facebook.com/RasmusAuction" target="_blank">Click here and &#8220;Like&#8221; Mr. Rasmus&#8217; company fan page.</a>

Why the second one? You&#8217;ll find out soon! Stay tuned.
