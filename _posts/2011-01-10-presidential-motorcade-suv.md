The email reads:

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>Have you ever wondered what all those extra SUVs are in Presidential or VIP motorcades? You know, the ones with severely tinted windows. The SUV&#8217;s that no one gets in or out of?</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>Well, wonder no more. They have a 6 barreled 7.62 mm mini Gatling guns.</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>They Fire over 4,000 rounds per minute. The wipers need to be run to remove spent casings when the weapon is firing. This video is from the company that makes the rigs. The vehicle is also armor plated.</em>
</p>

I added the following comments:

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <em>Supposedly, this is a video displaying the capabilities of the black SUVs seen in the presidential motorcade. The mini-gun looks like it is same one seen mounted on the side of Marine Corps UH-1N &#8220;Huey&#8221; helicopters. They fire about 4,000 rounds per minute of 7.62mm rounds through 6 rotating barrels (Gatling gun style).</em>

I lived in the DC area for almost a year and saw the presidential motorcade on a regular basis. Usually you would see these black SUVs pull out as part of the motorcade and the back glass would be down with secret service agents loaded into the back, armed to the teeth with M4-A1 rifles. Never realized there was a mini-gun loaded into the roof. Very slick.
