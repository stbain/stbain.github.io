## UPDATE: A circuit court judge has ordered Brandon Raub&#8217;s release. [More details here](http://www.businessinsider.com/lawyer-for-detained-marine-says-he-is-being-held-illegally-2012-8).

**Question**: What do all of these things have in common?

  * Suppression of free speech
  * Thought crime punishment from the fictional book _1984_
  * Political prisoner status from the cold war era U.S.S.R.
  * Warrantless arrest and imprisonment

**Answer**: They all remind me of [Brandon Raub](https://www.google.com/search?q=BRANDON+RAUB "Google "Brandon Raub"").

Even if I do not agree 100% with everything Brandon says and believes, I support his right to have and express his opinions. The fact that he is being illegally held against his will in [the very city I live in](http://www.salem.va.gov/) makes me sick to my stomach. This is not the last I will have to say about this topic. More to come.
