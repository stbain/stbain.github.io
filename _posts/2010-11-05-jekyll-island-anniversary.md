Over at [the Economic Collapse Blog](http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/), they postedÂ [an article about today being the 100th anniversary of 1910 Jekyll Island meeting that resulted in the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank](http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-federal-reserve-is-holding-a-conference-on-jekyll-island-to-celebrate-100-years-of-dominating-america-a-return-to-jekyll-island-the-origins-history-and-future-of-the-federal-reserve). As someone who studies economics and economic policies, I encourage you to take the time to research [the Federal Reserve](http://www.federalreserve.gov/) and [how it works](http://money.howstuffworks.com/fed.htm). Be sure to study both sides of the argument for and against the Fed. The Federal Reserve, of course, [sings its own praises](http://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pf.htm). However, there are [others](http://www.examiner.com/finance-examiner-in-national/congressman-ron-paul-and-senator-rand-paul-plan-to-try-to-dissolve-the-fed) who [disagree](http://www.amazon.com/End-Fed-Ron-Paul/dp/0446549193).
