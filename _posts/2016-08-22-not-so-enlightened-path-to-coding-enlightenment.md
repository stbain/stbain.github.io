A friend of mine is finishing up a BSCS and looking to get into the tech industry. Ready to code? Here&#8217;s the list I sent him&#8230;

  * Pick a Linux distro ([Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) or [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)). I would recommend Fedora if this is your first encounter with Linux.
  * Read [_How to Become a Hacker_](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)
  * Read [_The Art of Unix Programming_](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/)
  * Master Vim &#8211; (<a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vim.org/">http://www.vim.org/</a>) 
      * This is kind of a personal preference, as are all editors.
      * I recommend mastering vim because it is ubiquitous. You can run it on all of your workstations (Linux / Win) **and** you can usually depend on it being installed on just about every Linux server you SSH to.
      * Being able to use the same editor everywhere has its advantages.
  * Read [_Learn Python the Hard Way_](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
  * Read [_Pro Git_](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
  * <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/start/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.djangoproject.com/start/">Install Django</a>, then run through <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/">the tutorial</a>
  * Read _<a href="http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html">Test Driven Development with Python</a>_
  * Next&#8230;. JavaScript stuffs 
      * Learn JavaScript (don&#8217;t have a readily available book for this)
      * Learn Angular
      * Learn NodeJS
      * Learn Meteor
  * Along the way, you should pick up some knowledge about 
      * Cryptography
      * web services and REST APIs
      * security
      * networking
      * Databases 
          * Start with&#8230; 
              * MySQL
              * PostgreSQL
              * MongoDB
          * Move up to 
              * DynamoDB (Amazon&#8217;s AWS)
              * Hadoop
              * other NoSQL stuffs
              * Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server if you have to
