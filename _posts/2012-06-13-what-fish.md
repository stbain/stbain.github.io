Great joke in the mailbag today:

* * *

A redneck with a bucket full of live fish was approached recently by a game warden in Central Mississippi as he started to drive his boat away from a lake.  
The game warden asked the man, &#8220;May I see your fishing license please?&#8221;  
&#8220;Naw, sir,&#8221; replied the redneck. &#8220;I don&#8217;t need none of them there papers. These here are my pet fish.&#8221;  
&#8220;Pet fish??&#8221;  
&#8220;Yep. Once a week, I bring these here fish o&#8217;mine down to the lake and let &#8217;em swim &#8217;round for a while. Then when I whistle, they swim right back into my net and I take &#8217;em home.&#8221;  
&#8220;What a line of horse &#8230;you&#8217;re under arrest.  
The redneck said, &#8220;It&#8217;s the truth, Mr. Gov&#8217;ment Man. I&#8217;ll show ya! We do this all the time!!&#8221;  
&#8220;WE do, now, do WE?&#8221; smirked the warden. &#8220;PROVE it!&#8221;  
The redneck released the fish into the lake and stood and waited. After a few minutes, the warden said, &#8220;Well?&#8221;  
&#8220;Well, WHUT?&#8221; said the redneck.  
The warden asked, &#8220;When are you going to call them back?&#8221;  
&#8220;Call who back?&#8221;  
&#8220;The FISH,&#8221; replied the warden!  
&#8220;Whut fish?&#8221; asked the redneck.  
**MORAL OF THE STORY :**  
We may not be as smart as some city slickers, but we ain&#8217;t as dumb as some government employees.  
You can say what you want about the South, but you never hear of anyone retiring and moving north.
