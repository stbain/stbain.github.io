After [last week&#8217;s announcement regarding politics](http://stuartbain.com/2012/07/05/towards-the-battle/ "Towards the Battle"), some of my friends, family, and colleagues asked whether I am running for office and if so, which office I am running for. Just to clarify things, I am not currently running for any office. For now, my goal is to simply be active and involved again after taking some time off to focus on family, business, and tasks I had postponed for my 2010 campaign.

My plan is to help promote liberty and freedom whenever and wherever I can. When future opportunities to run for office present themselves, I will evaluate them as they come up.

I am humbled by the outpouring of support and encouragement. Thank you!
