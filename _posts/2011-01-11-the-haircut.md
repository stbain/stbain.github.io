This morning&#8217;s first mailbag entry is a joke sent by Dave W. I get quite a few jokes (of varying levels of decency) sent to me via email and will try to post them up when I can.

_Subject: THE HAIRCUT_

_A young boy had just received his driver&#8217;s permit and asked his father if they could discuss his use of the car._

_His father said he&#8217;d make a deal with his son. &#8216;You bring your grades up from a C to a B Average, study your Bible a little, get your hair cut and we&#8217;ll talk about the car._

_The boy thought about that for a moment, decided he&#8217;d settle for the offer and they agreed on it._

_After about six weeks his father said, &#8216;Son, I&#8217;m real proud of you. You brought your grades up and I&#8217;ve observed that you have been studying your Bible, but I&#8217;m disappointed you haven&#8217;t had your hair cut. &#8216;_

_The young man paused a moment then said, &#8216;You know, Dad, I&#8217;ve been thinking about that, and I&#8217;ve noticed in my studies of the Bible that Samson had long hair, John the Baptist had long hair, Moses had long hair and there&#8217;s even a strong argument that Jesus had long hair.&#8217;_

_To this his father replied, &#8216;Did you also notice that they all walked everywhere they went?&#8217;_
