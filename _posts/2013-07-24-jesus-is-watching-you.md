Saw this one on a friend&#8217;s Facebook wall:

* * *

_A burglar broke into a house one night. He shined his flashlight around, looking for valuables when a voice in the dark said, &#8216;Jesus knows you&#8217;re here.&#8217;_

_He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight off, and froze. When he heard nothing more, he shook his head and continued._

_Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard &#8216;Jesus is watching you.&#8217;_

_Startled, he shined his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot._

_&#8216;Did you say that?&#8217; he hissed at the parrot._

_&#8216;Yes&#8217;, the parrot confessed, then squawked, &#8216;I&#8217;m just trying to warn you that he&#8217;s watching you.&#8217;_

_The burglar relaxed. &#8216;Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?&#8217;_

_&#8216;Moses,&#8217; replied the bird._

_&#8216;Moses?&#8217; the burglar laughed. &#8216;What kind of people would name a bird Moses?&#8217;_

_&#8216;The kind of people who would name a Rottweiler Jesus.&#8217;_
