How much poison do you eat, on purpose, every day, and pay extra for it with your taxes without even realizing it? The truth is, a lot more than you probably think. You see, your taxes subsidize U.S. farmers. Here in the U.S., farmers grow corn&#8230; LOTS of corn&#8230; mountains of it every year. Corn is used to make High Fructose Corn Syrup, and that stuff is in everything from worchestire sauce to Gatorade. This video takes an hour and a half to watch, and it does have some technical mumbo jumbo in it. The video is a year or two old, but the chemistry and the science are still the same.Â Regardless, even non-medical people should be able to watch this and understand the underlying message: **stop poisoning yourself and your family**.
