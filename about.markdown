My name is Stuart Bain. I was born and raised in Roanoke, Virginia. I served in the United States Marine Corps after high school and studied computer science and business at Virginia Tech and American Sentinel University. My wife Sarah and I now live in Salem, Virginia and have three children. I work for Amazon Web Services as a Solutions Architect. 

I am a musician, avid gamer, and enjoy being active in politics when I can.
